# Text-Recognition-using-CNN-for-visually-imapired-people.
Project recognizes English text using Deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN). It is a special type of Neural Network which has given a great output in Image Processing and Computer Vision.Further,the english recognised text is then converted to Speech and Braille for visually impaired people.The accuracy of the model is 80.25% and value accuracy is 90.34%.
Modules: Image Pre-processing,Segmentation,Extraction,Training and Optimisation,Braille Conversion,Speech Conversion.
